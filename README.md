# AWS DevOps Project - GitHub Integration 🍒

This project is part of the **7-Day DevOps Challenge** where I’m building a CI/CD pipeline step-by-step. In this part of the challenge, I set up a GitHub repository and pushed my AWS-backed project from a remote EC2 instance.

## 🚀 What I Did

- Initialized a local Git repository
- Configured Git identity and remote origin
- Committed source code files
- Pushed the project to GitHub using secure authentication

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux)
- Git & GitHub
- Visual Studio Code
- Java (Maven Web Project)

## 🎯 Goal

To learn how to manage code repositories professionally and integrate cloud-hosted environments with version control platforms like GitHub.

## 💡 Next Steps

This is just Day 2 of the challenge. In the next project, I’ll start configuring build tools and automate more of the deployment process!
